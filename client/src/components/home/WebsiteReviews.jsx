// approved review sits in a carousel, and the form opens from the "Write a
// review" button instead of sitting open on the page. Only reviews written by
// real accounts are shown, with the reviewer's name and profile picture.
//
// The blush background and the section spacing live here; the eyebrow, heading
// and cards are rendered by the section, so the whole band is one centred block.
