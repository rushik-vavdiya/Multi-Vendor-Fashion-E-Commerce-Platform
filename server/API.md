# Backend API reference

This document describes the HTTP endpoints registered by the Rynova backend.

## Base URL and conventions

- Local development base URL: `http://localhost:5000/api` (the port can be changed with `PORT`).
- All paths below are relative to `/api`. For example, `GET /products` means `GET http://localhost:5000/api/products`.
- JSON endpoints accept and return JSON. Image and review-media endpoints use `multipart/form-data`.
- Successful responses generally use `{ "success": true, "message": "...", "data": ... }`. List endpoints may return a `pagination` object. Errors are passed to the shared error middleware and use a `success: false` response.
- Replace path parameters such as `:productId` with the corresponding record ID.
- Endpoints marked **Bearer** require `Authorization: Bearer <access-token>`. The token must be valid and belong to an active user. Endpoints marked **Admin**, **Customer**, or **Vendor** additionally require that role.
- Public endpoints do not require a token unless stated otherwise. Product and category reads accept an optional valid bearer token to allow admins and vendors to see records that are not public.

## Configuration notes

- Email verification and password recovery depend on the SMTP mail settings configured in the server environment.
- Razorpay payment creation, verification, refunds, and webhooks require the corresponding Razorpay keys and webhook secret.
- Image and review-media uploads rely on the configured upload/storage integration.
- The backend does not expose KYC verification endpoints.
